title: Statistics

## *"The most important questions of life are, for the most part, really only problems of probability."*

### *-Laplace* 

Here are a bunch of resources I've encountered as well as notes I'm typing up. I've had prior exposure to multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and upper-div probability and statistics.  I'm not starting from scratch, so I'm unsure how helpful these would be to someone who was. Your mileage may vary. 

I'm very open to suggestions/comments! [my first name][my last name]1@protonmail.com

### Notes 
- [Stanford Stats 200](https://github.com/riley-wilson/math_notes/blob/main/Stats_200/Stats_200_notes.pdf)
- UCLA Math 171, [stochastic processes](https://github.com/riley-wilson/math_notes/tree/main/math_171). 

### Links 
- [Stanford Stats 200](https://web.stanford.edu/class/stats200/index.html). (Perfect for someone with some exposure to university-level statistics)
- [Hogg](https://faculty.ksu.edu.sa/sites/default/files/677_fr37hij.pdf), Probability and Statistical Inference. (undergrad textbook at UCLA. I found it clear and straightforward)
- [Rice](https://korivernon.com/documents/MathematicalStatisticsandDataAnalysis3ed.pdf), Mathematical Statistics and Data Analysis. (I'm not a fan but this book keeps coming up in syllabi. I've found some explanations too cursory for my taste.)
- [Efron and Hastie](https://hastie.su.domains/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf) Computer Age Statistical Inference. (The first couple chapters do a wonderful job of laying out frequentism/bayesianism. I can tell the authors care at least some about the philosophy of probability. I haven't used this book much but it looks good.)
- [Wasserman](https://egrcc.github.io/docs/math/all-of-statistics.pdf) All of Statistics. (Looks like a broader introduction to stats than most undergrad textbooks. Probably good though I haven't used it much.)
- [Statquest](https://statquest.org/video-index/#statistics). (I don't prefer to learn via video, but this is the 3blue1brown of statistics.)
