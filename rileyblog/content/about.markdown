## *A jack of all trades but a master of none, en route to becoming a master of some*

There are only two ways I can learn: writing and solving problems. My first priority as a writer is to be understood. If I write something confusing, I am likely confused.

Here are some professional facts about me in chronological order:

- Attended UCLA. Studied philosophy (analytic) with a math minor. 
- Founded an e-learning company with the indefatigable [Michael Ioffe](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelaioffe/). It's extant and called [Arist](https://arist.co).
- Joined [Contrary](https://contrary.com) as Chief of Staff on their investment team. 
- Did growth work for [The Lunar Society](https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/). 
- Currently researching generative AI solutions for [Radicle](https://radicleinsights.com/). 

[Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rileywilson9/) is my LinkedIn. 

I'm currently searching for my next role. I'm looking for something analytical, since I'm very happy taking a messy question and finding order, whether through quantitative or qualitative means. 

The JDs that most excite me usually say "operations" or "data" somewhere, though I don't discriminate by title. Organization-wise, I'd love to work at a Series A+ startup. 

Feel free to email me about anything (seriously!). I respond within 24 hours.
